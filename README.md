# Linux Mint

This mock website is inspired by the Linux Mint Cinnamon Desktop own website. It is intended to continue with the new style and revamp a now outdated look in the actual Linux Mint OS website.

It is constructed without any libraries and only taking advantage of CSS flexbox and CSS grid to achieve responsiveness across devices.

### Installing

Because it is built with only native CSS and html you don't need to install anything. Just open index.html on your browser.
